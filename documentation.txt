I have ssh'd into SFU csil servers and have verified that
python3 is installed, so I have decided to use python3 for
my client and server. If for some reason your machine is 
missing python3, change the shebangs in both files to 
#!/usr/bin/env python2
and remove the ConnectionRefusedError exception from the client

I have included a test file "file" for you.

0. Make server.py and client.py executable
chmod +x server.py client.py

1. Start the server in its own terminal
./server.py

2. Start the client in its own terminal as per requirements:
./client.py localhost 12000 file GET
./client.py localhost 12000 file HEAD
./client.py localhost 12000 nonexistingfile GET
./client.py localhost 12000 nonexistingfile HEAD

3. Client will download files from the server into the same
directory but with DL_ prepended to its file name
